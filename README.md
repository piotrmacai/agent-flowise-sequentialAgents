Sequential Content Enhancement Agent ðŸ¤–
A Flowise-based sequential agent system that leverages multiple LLMs for content creation and self-improvement.

![Workflow Overview](img/FlowiseSequentialAgent.jpg)

Overview
This project implements a sequential agent workflow where multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) work together to generate and enhance content. The system consists of:

Content Creation Agent: Primary LLM for generating initial content
Review & Enhancement Agent: Secondary LLM for analyzing and improving the generated content
Sequential processing pipeline for iterative refinement

System Architecture
The workflow consists of several key components:

ChatOpenAI Node: Handles initial content generation
Serp API Integration: Enables real-time data enrichment
Agent Memory System: Maintains context across iterations
Conditional Logic: Controls content flow and improvement cycles
LLM Review Node: Performs quality assessment and enhancement
